# gulpease-index
The Gulpease index is a readability metric for the Italian language, but it's also widely used for other languages. The script takes a PDF file as input and calculates the Gulpease score, providing insight into the document's composition. It's a handy tool to measure the complexity of your written content. Feel free to clone the repository and use the script to analyze the readability of your documents.
The index is calculated with the following formula:

$G = 89 - \left[(LP / 10) + (FR * 3)\right]$

Where:

**LP** = (total number of letters in the sample multiplied by 100) divided by the total number of words.

**FR** = (total of sentences in the sample multiplied by 100) divided by the total of the words.
